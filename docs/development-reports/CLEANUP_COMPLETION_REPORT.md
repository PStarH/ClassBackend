```

### Naming Conventions Applied
- ✅ **Views:** Consistent `*View` or `*ViewSet` naming
- ✅ **Models:** Clear model names with proper relationships
- ✅ **Services:** Service-oriented architecture with clear separation
- ✅ **URLs:** RESTful URL patterns with version prefixes
- ✅ **Files:** Logical grouping and descriptive naming

## 🔗 Inter-Service Integration Verification

### LangChain ↔ PostgreSQL ↔ Django
```python
# Integration Test Results ✅
✅ Cache Service: Working
✅ User Model Query: 1 users in database  
✅ LangChain Advisor Service: Available
✅ Django Database Engine: django.db.backends.postgresql
✅ Django Cache Backend: django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache
```

### Data Flow Verification
1. **Frontend Request** → Django REST API
2. **Django API** → PostgreSQL (user data, progress)
3. **Django API** → LangChain Services (AI processing)
4. **LangChain** → External LLM APIs (with caching)
5. **Response** → Cached and returned to frontend

---

## 📋 Frontend Documentation
